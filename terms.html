  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">1</span> Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using AssetTag ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
    <p>These Terms apply to all users of AssetTag, including users on the free plan and users with paid subscriptions.</p>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">2</span> Description of Service</h2>
    <p>AssetTag is a mobile application that enables individuals and organisations to track, manage, and tag physical assets using QR codes and barcodes. Your data is stored in a Microsoft Excel file on your own cloud storage account (OneDrive, Google Drive, or SharePoint).</p>
    <p>We offer a free tier and paid subscription tiers. Features available on each tier are described in the App and on our website. We reserve the right to change the features included in each tier with reasonable notice.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">3</span> Account and Access</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Sign-in</h3>
    <p>AssetTag requires you to sign in using a Microsoft account or a Google account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Microsoft or Google account. We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain account security.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Organisational accounts</h3>
    <p>If you create an organisation within AssetTag and invite other users, you are the "Organisation Admin" and are responsible for managing access to your organisation's asset data. You must ensure that any users you invite agree to these Terms before using the App.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Your data</h3>
    <p>Your asset data is stored in an Excel file on your own cloud storage. You retain full ownership of that data. AssetTag does not claim any ownership of your asset records, photos, or any other content you create using the App.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">4</span> Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Subscription tiers</h3>
    <p>AssetTag offers the following paid plans, billed monthly through Google Play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starter:</strong> £4.99/month — up to 5 users and 100 assets</li>
      <li><strong>Growth:</strong> £12.99/month — up to 20 users and 500 assets</li>
      <li><strong>Unlimited:</strong> £29.99/month — unlimited users and assets</li>
      <li><strong>Add-on: +5 Users:</strong> £2.99/month</li>
      <li><strong>Add-on: +100 Assets:</strong> £1.99/month</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices are in GBP and include applicable taxes. Google Play may charge in your local currency at the prevailing exchange rate.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Billing</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions are billed monthly through your Google Play account. Payment is charged to your Google Play payment method at the start of each billing period. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Free trial</h3>
    <p>Where a free trial is offered, it will be clearly stated in the App. Your payment method will be charged at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before the trial ends.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Cancellation and refunds</h3>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you will retain access to paid features until that date. Refunds are handled by Google Play in accordance with their refund policy.</p>

    <h3>4.5 Downgrade effects</h3>
    <p>If you downgrade to a lower tier and your current usage exceeds the new tier's limits, you will not lose existing data. However, you will be unable to add new assets or users until your usage is within the new tier's limits.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Free tier limits:</strong> The free tier is limited to 1 user and 25 assets. These limits are enforced within the App. Attempting to circumvent these limits (e.g. by editing the Excel file directly) is a violation of these Terms and may result in account suspension.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">5</span> Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use AssetTag only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not use the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law or regulation</li>
      <li>To track assets you do not own or have authorisation to manage</li>
      <li>To store sensitive personal data about individuals (e.g. personal identification numbers, medical records) in asset records</li>
      <li>To attempt to circumvent subscription limits or any other technical restrictions of the App</li>
      <li>To reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App</li>
      <li>To use the App in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair our services</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">6</span> Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>AssetTag and its original content (excluding your data), features, and functionality are owned by the AssetTag developer and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the App for your personal or internal business purposes in accordance with these Terms.</p>
    <p>You retain all rights to your asset data. By using the App, you grant us no rights to your data beyond what is strictly necessary to provide the service (i.e. reading and writing your Excel file at your request).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">7</span> Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <h3>7.1 No warranty</h3>
    <p>AssetTag is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

    <h3>7.2 Your data is your responsibility</h3>
    <p>Because your asset data is stored in your own cloud drive, we are not responsible for data loss resulting from accidental deletion of your Excel file, loss of access to your Microsoft or Google account, or any action taken by Microsoft or Google affecting your cloud storage.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend maintaining regular backups of your Excel file.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, AssetTag and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the App.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or £50, whichever is greater.</p>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">8</span> Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part of it at any time. We will provide reasonable advance notice of material changes where possible.</p>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via a notice in the App or by email. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="num">9</span> Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms or if we are required to do so by law.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Your data remains in your Excel file on your cloud drive — termination of your App account does not delete your data.</p>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time. Cancel your subscription through Google Play before uninstalling to avoid further charges.</p>
